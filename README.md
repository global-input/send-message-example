## Form Data Transfer
This is the source code of [a demo application](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/send-message), demonstrating how you can use the [Global Input App library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react) to achieve [Mobile Authentication](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-authentication), [Mobile Input](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-input-control), [Mobile Control](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-input-control), and [Mobile Content Transfer](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-content-transfer) on a React.js application. Your application can request data on-demand from the [Mobile Personal Storage](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-personal-storage), so that you can implement personalized services without collecting user information into your databases. The communication between the mobile and your application is secured using end-to-end encryption. 

### How to Run

```
   git clone https://github.com/global-input/send-message-example.git
