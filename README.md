This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Then, the global-input-app extension dependency is added:

```
npm i @bit/globalinput.web.global-input-connect
```


Then one UI dependency for text field is added. You can replace it with your preferred JavaScript libraries:

```


npm i @bit/globalinput.web.input-with-label

```

Then, the web application together with the mobile logic is implemented.

You can run the application using ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start``` command:<br>
```
npm run start
```
This will display a QR code. Scan the QR code displayed with your [Global Input App](https://globalinput.co.uk/) on your mobile to start to use your mobile to operate on your applications.
